# Django Blogging Platform

A modern multi-author blogging application built with Django.
It supports secure authentication, responsive design, and a full author workflow — from writing to publishing and analytics.

 Overview

This platform allows multiple users to register, log in, and publish blog posts in a shared environment.
Each author manages their own posts privately in the admin and dashboard while posts are publicly visible on the homepage after publication.
